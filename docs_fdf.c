//This is the documentation for doing the fdf journey.
//what I understood from the project now is the following:
1-Get a map as Matrix of numbers
2-Parse it to pointer of pointers
3-Then go thorgh it item by item to put it as a pixel on an Image
4-Hold on
5-I believe you should do some calculations first to put it on a new matrix after some math
6-Put them as pixels on an Image
7-Present it using Minilibx
8-Make sure that the image is smooth(Responsive, still the same upon changing the size of the window)
9-ESC || (x)  close the window and free() everything
